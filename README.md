# Overview

As a Computer Engineer learning about software, I am reenforcing my knowledge of the basics of Python. I have learned other languages as well. It is my goal to keep learning and practicing my skills in programming. 

The program I wrote in this directory displays "Hello world!". Although it's a simple program, I wanted to have an example available to me containing some basic knowledge of Python. That's why I chose to display the phrase using a function. I have a demonstration showing the final product in action linked below. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to edit and create this program. I used Python because its syntax is different from other languages I have used like C++. It's straight forward syntax makes it easy for beginners to start programming. Although it's not a very efficient language, it helped me to understand concepts I struggled with in languages like C++.
